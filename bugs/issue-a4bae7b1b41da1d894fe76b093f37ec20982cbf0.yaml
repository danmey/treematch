title: Allow basic types in variants
desc: |-
  It may be useful to allow basic types (int, string, ...) within variant type
  definitions in treematch. Currently, the ptree-treematch backend produces one
  type alias per typed terminal. This may or may not be what we want, but we are
  likely not to want this restriction for subsequent tree specs.
