title: Inline type definitions in treematch
desc: |-
  Treematch has enough knowledge to automatically (heuristically) generate an
  improved type definition from an existing one by inlining trivial types and
  types used once.
  
  Only types with no mutual recursion can be inlined.

    This might even work on more complex type definitions such as Expression in
    the C++ grammar, which has one (or at least only a few) entry point(s) and one
    recursive entry point. In between, there is no mutual recursion.
