title: Add treematch syntax for list and option
desc: |-
  The current ptree backend has special support for list and option
  nonterminals. In treematch, they are represented as local Head/Tail and local
  None/Some. It will be better for interoperability with existing (library) code
  if these kinds are represented as existing language constructs (read:
  parametrised types 'a list and 'a option).

  - Now the ast part works. Type/AST inferences needs fixing (typing.ml), so not closing this down
